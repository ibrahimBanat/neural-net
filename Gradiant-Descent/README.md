## Implementing Gradient Descent
<p>In the following notebook, you'll be able to imp<p>implement the gradient descent algorithm on the following sample dataset with two classes.

<p>In this notebook, you'll be implementing the functions that build the gradient descent algorithm, namely:

`sigmoid`: The sigmoid activation function.

`output_formula`: The formula for the prediction.

`error_formula`: The formula for the error at a point.

`update_weights`: The function that updates the parameters with one gradient descent step.

When you implement them, run the train function and this will graph the several of the lines that are drawn in successive gradient descent steps. It will also graph the error function, and you can see it decreasing as the number of epochs grows.
